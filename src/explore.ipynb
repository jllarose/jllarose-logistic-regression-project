    "it would imply that 'no' is somehow double 'yes' - makes no sense. The proper way to do this is with 'one hot' encoding. This technique uses a new binary categorical feature for each level of the original scale. Every example then gets a '1' to indicate it's level in the original feature. Here's what one hot encoding a few hypothetical examples for *housing* would look like:\n",

    "\n",
    "However, there is one issue with this: the above table looks intuitively good, but it introduces multicolinearity. Notice how the sum of all three one hot encoding features for any row is one? This is a problem for many machine learning models and is known as the 'dummy variable' problem. Without going into too much detail, we actually only need two one hot encoded variables to encode three feature levels and only four to encode five levels and so on. It's always one less than the original levels we are trying to encode.

A likely business use case for this type of model is targeting sales & advertising spend. We don't want to waste a bunch of time and money calling people who aren't going to take out a deposit. There are much better metrics for this type of situation. To build some intuition about why accuracy is not great for this task, let's imagine a hypothetical scenario and see what effect our models have on the bank's bottom line."

    "You just earned the company an additional ~$170,000 on the next marketing campaign. This is why being a good data scientist is well paying job.

    "The base model is more conservative with it's predictions overall - it predicts 'yes' less often. In doing so, it makes fewer incorrect predictions, resulting it a higher overall accuracy. But, it predicts 'no' when it should have predicted 'yes' more often than the weighted model does. Therefore it misses out on a lot of revenue! The weighted model is more aggressive. It predicts 'yes' much more often overall and gets a lower 'accuracy' score. But, because the revenue from a deposit is greater than the cost to call the customer, it performs better by missing fewer sales than the base model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common type of scenario, where the true costs of the error types are not equal. Similarly, the benefits of the correct prediction types may also not be equal. For this reason, it is always a good idea to look at a confusion matrix when evaluating a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Classification loss: binary cross-entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we tell that the weighted model is 'better' than the base model without the complicated example or looking at a plot? If we are doing, for example, automated hyperparameter optimization, it's nice to have a single number we can directly compare. There are many options for this type of thing - but one in particular that is useful in this case is the Matthews correlation coefficient. It does a much better job of taking true and false negative and positives into account than accuracy alone:"
